     *  `transfer` will set the `FreeBalance` of the sender and receiver.
     *  It will decrease the total issuance of the system by the `TransferFee`.
     *  If the sender's account is below the existential deposit as a result
     *  of the transfer, the account will be reaped.
     * 
     *  The dispatch origin for this call must be `Signed` by the transactor.

     *  # <weight>
     *  - Dependent on arguments but not critical, given proper implementations for
     *    input config types. See related functions below.
     *  - It contains a limited number of reads and writes internally and no complex computation.
     * 
     *  Related functions:
     * 
     *    - `ensure_can_withdraw` is always called internally but has a bounded complexity.
     *    - Transferring balances to accounts that did not exist before will cause
     *       `T::OnNewAccount::on_new_account` to be called.
     *    - Removing enough funds from an account will trigger `T::DustRemoval::on_unbalanced`.
     *    - `transfer_keep_alive` works the same way as `transfer`, but has an additional
     *      check that the transfer will not kill the origin account.
