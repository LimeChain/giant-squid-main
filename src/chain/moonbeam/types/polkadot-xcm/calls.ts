     *    deposit them to `beneficiary`.
     *  - `TransferType::RemoteReserve(reserve)`: burn local assets, forward XCM to `reserve`
     *    chain to move reserves from this chain's SA to `dest` chain's SA, and forward another
     *    XCM to `dest` to mint and deposit reserve-based assets to `beneficiary`. Typically

     * 
     * On the destination chain, as well as any intermediary hops, `BuyExecution` is used to
     * buy execution using transferred `assets` identified by `remote_fees_id`.

     *   This is usually as simple as:
     *   `Xcm(vec![DepositAsset { assets: Wild(AllCounted(assets.len())), beneficiary }])`,
     *   but could be something more exotic like sending the `assets` even further.
     * 
     * - `origin`: Must be capable of withdrawing the `assets` and executing XCM.
     * - `dest`: Destination context for the assets. Will typically be `[Parent,
     *   Parachain(..)]` to send from parachain to parachain, or `[Parachain(..)]` to send from
     *   relay to parachain, or `(parents: 2, (GlobalConsensus(..), ..))` to send from
     *   parachain across a bridge to another ecosystem destination.
     * - `assets`: The assets to be withdrawn. This should include the assets used to pay the
     *   fee on the `dest` (and possibly reserve) chains.
     * - `assets_transfer_type`: The XCM `TransferType` used to transfer the `assets`.
     * - `remote_fees_id`: One of the included `assets` to be be used to pay fees.
     * - `fees_transfer_type`: The XCM `TransferType` used to transfer the `fees` assets.
     * - `custom_xcm_on_dest`: The XCM to be executed on `dest` chain as the last step of the
     *   transfer, which also determines what happens to the assets on the destination chain.
